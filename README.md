# Revisiting Data Structures

Once learned.  
Mostly forgotten.  
Now being revisited.

No deadlines.  
No optimization contests.  
No pretending this is my first time.

This repo is me taking another look at things I thought I understood,
at a pace that doesn’t involve panic.

Sometimes it clicks.  
Sometimes it doesn’t.  
Both are fine.

Work in progress.  
Confidence sold separately.
