# Revisiting Data Structures

Once learned.  
Mostly forgotten.  
Now being revisited.

No deadlines.  
No optimization contests.  
No pretending this is my first time.

---

This repo is me taking another look at things I thought I understood,
at a pace that doesn’t involve panic.

Sometimes it clicks.  
Sometimes it doesn’t.  
Both are fine.

Work in progress.  
Confidence sold separately.
